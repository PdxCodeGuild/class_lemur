# Lab 04: Mob Class Mascot

Create a page celebrating our class mascot.  Before coding, spend some time with your team talking over your goals for the website.  Ask questions like these:  
  
* What is the content of the page?  What information should it convey to the user?
* What is the aesthetic of the page?  What is the color scheme?  Is it bright or muted?  Will there be large imagess or small ones?  Will there be more text or more whitespace?
* What is the layout of the page?  Is there navbar?  If so, should it be a topnav or a sidenav?
* Will you use a CSS library like Bootsrap, Materialize, Skeleton, or Bulma?  Or will you write your own css?

The tone of the page is completely up to you.  It can be realistic or fantastical.  

Make a new git branch for this lab:
```console
$ git checkout main # switch to the main branch
$ git pull # pull any changes from origin into your local main branch
$ git checkout -b [your-new-branch-name] # create and switch to a new branch
$ git push -u origin [your-new-branch-name] # push your branch AND set an upstream origin on GitHub (this command only needs to be done when the branch does not already exist on GitHub)
```
Rotate typing responsibilities every 30-45 mins.  The current typist will push to GitHub and the next one will...
```console
$ git checkout [your-new-branch-name] # switch to the branch
$ git pull # pull the latest from that branch (git pull with no arguments pulls the branch you are on)
$ git push # when done typing, use git push to push changes to the branch on GitHub
```
