A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!\nMany a thing you know you'd like to tell her\nMany a thing she ought to understand\nBut how do you make her stay\nAnd listen to all you say\nHow do you keep a wave upon the sand\nOh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?\nHow do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?\nWhen I'm with her I'm confused\nOut of focus and bemused\nAnd I never know exactly where I am\nUnpredictable as weather\nShe's as flighty as a feather\nShe's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!\nShe'd outpester any pest\nDrive a hornet from its nest\nShe could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl\nShe is gentle! She is wild!\nShe's a riddle! She's a child!\nShe's a headache! She's an angel!\nShe's a girl!\nHow do you solve a problem like Maria?\nHow do you catch a cloud and pin it down?\nHow do you find a word that means Maria?\nA flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!\nMany a thing you know you'd like to tell her\nMany a thing she ought to understand\nBut how do you make her stay\nAnd listen to all you say\nHow do you keep a wave upon the sand\nOh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?\nHow do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?",
