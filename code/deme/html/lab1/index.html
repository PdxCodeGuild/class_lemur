<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Nick Burkhardt is the protagonist of the fantasy drama "Grimm". Nick works as a detective for Portland PD which aids in his advantage to his adventures as a Grimm. A Grimm is a blood-line trait in which humans are able to see creatures known as "wessen" who have a human appearance, which disguise their real fantastical-like identity which can range from werewolves to snake-like beings. Nick has lived with his girlfiend Juliette for 5 years. In the show, he often solves crimes with his partner, Hank, while secretly investigating more seemingly supernatural like crimes with his Wessen associate, Monroe. Typically Grimms and Wessens have been mortal enemies, however, Nick is breaking down the barrier for the common good of man and Wessen-kind.
