                Full-Stack Developer in the making! I have an inclination to study anything that fascinates me and figure out how it works from the base level. I am intrigued by technology, especially on the mechanical engineering side, and how it correlates with the growing technological world. I have a wide variety of world and work experience, from my time in the Marine Corps as an Anti-Tank Missileman to working and fixing vehicles, which has now become a fond hobby.
