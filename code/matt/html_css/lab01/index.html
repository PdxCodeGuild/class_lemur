    <h1>Eivor Varinsdottir</h1>

    <h2 style="font-size: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">AC Valhalla</h2>

    <p>Eivor was born in 847 AD to Varin, a chieftain who paid tribute to Styrbjorn,
        a king in Southern Norway. Eivor was raised as a warrior, fed myths and sagas
        of heroism from a young age.She dedicated her life to becoming a peerless warrior
        and famed hero.Eivor grew to be a tremendously skilled fighter and brilliant strategist,
        eventually earning a position as Berserker to Sigurd. It was not just her skill on the
        battlefield that made him invaluable. Eivor was highly intelligent, a devourer of
        stories and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eivor had a number of titles, with one of the most prominent being the title of “Wolf-Kissed.”
        This is directly attributable to how she got the scar on her face. As a child,
        Eivor was left to her own devices after her parents’ death. At some point following this,
        she found herself at a frozen lake.

        It was here that Eivor was attacked by a wolf. Her first hallucination of Odin occurred around this time,
        allowing her to kill the wolf with an axe and gain the title.
